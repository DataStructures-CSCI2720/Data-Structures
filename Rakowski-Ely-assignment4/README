How to run the file:
    "make runint" runs the ./main int-input1.txt
    "make runfloat" runs the ./main float-input1.txt
    "make runstring" runs the ./main string-input1.txt

Explanation of additional methods:

    getNumSingleParent():
    Using a pointer to the root node, the method recursively
    iterates through the list and finds nodes with only one child
    pointer using a XOR gate. Returns a final count.
    Recurrence relation: T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + 1
    Based on the master theorem, O(n) = n

    getNumLeafNodes():
    Using a pointer to the root node, the method recursively
    iterates through the list and finds nodes with no child pointers
    and returns the final count.
    Recurrence relation: T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + 1
    Based on the master theorem, O(n) = n

    getSumOfSubtrees():
    Using a pointer to the root node, the method recursively
    iterates through the list and adds the values together. Returns
    a T object containing the summation of subtree items.
    Recurrence relation: T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + 1
    Based on the master theorem, O(n) = n
